# SDLC:

SDLC stands for software development life cycle.

SDLc is a structure process that enables the production of high quality ,
low cost software ,in the shortest possible production time .

SDLC involves:

1)Analysis
2)Designing
3)Development
4)Testing
5)Deploymrnt
6)Maintenance

==>Planning and Analysis involves checking the market need of the project .
It invloves defining the purpose of the application

This step is important and it helps to see that the project doesn't deviate 
from it's original purpose and plan.

==> Designing involves seeing how the application will work.

As the name suggests designing has to do with the user interface and design 
of the application.It involves managing how the application wil appear and respond 
to input .Designing  has to do with the front end development.

==>Software developement has to do with actual writing of the program and involves 
use of back end development languages .In this case source code is managed.

==>Software testing as the name suggest ,has to do with testing of the application,
whether the  application meets the requirement and the goal that was set during the 
analysis phase.Software testing is automated or manually done. Software testing involves
finding errors and glitches and has to do with fixing those problems.

==>Deplyment has to do with introducing the application to the market or launching it to 
the users.

==>In Maintenance, development cycle is almost finished but the maintenance part is still
important. In this phase,the other bugs discovered by user which weren't found during 
testing are resolved and as the name suggests this phase has to do with maintenance of 
the launched application. 

#DFD:

DFD stands for Data Flow Diagram.

==>A Data flow diagram is a mean of presenting the flow of data through a process or 
a system which includes the input as well as output entity.
